# Mindustry Logic Blocks

A scratch-like visual editor for Mindustry's Logic Processors available at [https://mlog.reheatedcake.io/](https://mlog.reheatedcake.io/).

No need to download anything but the code you write!

Uses [Google's Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) with custom blocks and code generation.

## Notes

- Code is run from the top left.
- Placing functions above your first line will cause the function code to run before the first line.
- If you have functions and no `end` block at the end of your program, the functions will run after your code runs.
- Recursion only works if you place the recursive function call in the return statement of the function. (See below)
