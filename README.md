# Mindustry Logic Blocks

A scratch-like visual editor for Mindustry's Logic Processors available at [https://mlog.reheatedcake.io/](https://mlog.reheatedcake.io/).

Uses [Google's Blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly) with custom blocks and code generation.

## Notes

* Code is run from the top left.
* Placing functions above your first line will cause the function code to run before the first line.
* If you have functions and no `end` block at the end of your program, the functions will run after your code runs.
* Recursion only works if you place the recursive function call in the return statement of the function. (See below)
